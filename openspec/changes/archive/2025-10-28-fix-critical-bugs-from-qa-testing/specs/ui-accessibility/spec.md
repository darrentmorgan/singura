#### Scenario: Required fields indicated accessibly
- **WHEN** a form input is required
- **THEN** the input SHALL have `aria-required="true"` attribute

- **THEN** pressing Tab SHALL move focus to the button
- **AND** pressing Enter or Space SHALL trigger button action
- **AND** button SHALL have visible focus indicator
- **AND** button SHALL NOT be a div with onClick (use semantic <button>)

- **AND** the button SHALL have `aria-controls` pointing to dropdown menu ID
- **AND** screen reader SHALL announce expansion state

### Requirement: WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance
