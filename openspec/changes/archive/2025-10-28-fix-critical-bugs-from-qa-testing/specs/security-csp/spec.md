# Security - Content Security Policy

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Content Security Policy Configuration
The system SHALL implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) that balances security with functionality, preventing XSS attacks while allowing necessary features.

#### Scenario: CSP blocks unauthorized scripts
- **WHEN** the application loads
- **THEN** the CSP SHALL block inline scripts without nonces
- **AND** the CSP SHALL block scripts from unauthorized domains
- **AND** the CSP SHALL prevent eval() and Function() constructor usage (unless WebAssembly required)

#### Scenario: CSP allows necessary resources
- **WHEN** the application loads
- **THEN** the CSP SHALL allow scripts from 'self' origin
- **AND** the CSP SHALL allow WebSocket connections to configured endpoints
- **AND** the CSP SHALL allow HTTPS images from any source
- **AND** the CSP SHALL allow data URIs for images and fonts
- **AND** the CSP SHALL allow styles from 'self' and 'unsafe-inline' (required for TailwindCSS/styled-components)

#### Scenario: No CSP violations in console
- **WHEN** the user navigates through the application
- **THEN** the browser console SHALL NOT show CSP violation warnings
- **AND** all features SHALL work as expected
- **AND** CSP violations SHALL be logged to monitoring system

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: WebAssembly CSP Investigation
The system SHALL audit WebAssembly usage before configuring CSP policy to determine if `wasm-unsafe-eval` is necessary.

#### Scenario: WebAssembly usage audited
- **WHEN** CSP policy is being configured
- **THEN** the codebase SHALL be scanned for WebAssembly usage (`grep -r "WebAssembly" "\.wasm"`)
- **AND** dependencies SHALL be checked for WebAssembly requirements (`npm list | grep wasm`)
- **AND** the audit results SHALL be documented
- **AND** CSP policy SHALL be configured based on audit results

#### Scenario: WebAssembly not required
- **WHEN** WebAssembly audit shows no usage
- **THEN** the CSP SHALL NOT include 'wasm-unsafe-eval' directive
- **AND** the CSP SHALL maintain strict `script-src` policy
- **AND** any library causing false positive violations SHALL be identified and documented

#### Scenario: WebAssembly required with whitelisted sources
- **WHEN** WebAssembly audit shows specific library usage
- **AND** the WebAssembly source is known and trusted
- **THEN** the CSP SHALL whitelist the specific WebAssembly source URL
- **AND** the CSP SHALL NOT use blanket 'wasm-unsafe-eval'
- **AND** the whitelist decision SHALL be documented with justification

#### Scenario: WebAssembly required without known source
- **WHEN** WebAssembly audit shows usage
- **AND** the WebAssembly source cannot be whitelisted
- **THEN** the CSP SHALL include 'wasm-unsafe-eval' directive as last resort
- **AND** the decision SHALL be documented with security review
- **AND** a plan SHALL be created to migrate to whitelisted sources
- **AND** the security team SHALL approve the policy change

### Requirement: CSP Policy Documentation
The system SHALL document all CSP policy decisions and changes for security audit compliance.

#### Scenario: CSP policy documented
- **WHEN** CSP policy is configured or changed
- **THEN** each directive SHALL be documented with its purpose
- **AND** any relaxed restrictions SHALL be documented with justification
- **AND** the documentation SHALL include affected features
- **AND** the documentation SHALL be reviewed by security team

#### Scenario: CSP changes tracked in audit log
- **WHEN** CSP policy is modified
- **THEN** the change SHALL be logged to audit system
- **AND** the log SHALL include who made the change and when
- **AND** the log SHALL include the reason for the change
- **AND** the log SHALL include before/after policy comparison

### Requirement: CSP Violation Reporting
The system SHALL implement CSP violation reporting to detect potential security issues and policy misconfigurations.

#### Scenario: CSP violations reported to backend
- **WHEN** a CSP violation occurs in the browser
- **THEN** the browser SHALL send a violation report to `/api/csp-report`
- **AND** the backend SHALL log the violation details
- **AND** the backend SHALL include: violated directive, blocked URI, document URI, timestamp
- **AND** the backend SHALL respond with HTTP 204 (No Content)

#### Scenario: CSP violation monitoring
- **WHEN** CSP violations are reported
- **THEN** violations SHALL be aggregated by type and frequency
- **AND** high-frequency violations SHALL trigger alerts
- **AND** unexpected violations SHALL be investigated as potential attacks
- **AND** violation patterns SHALL be reviewed weekly

### Requirement: CSP Testing and Validation
The system SHALL verify CSP policy works correctly without blocking legitimate functionality.

#### Scenario: CSP policy tested in report-only mode first
- **WHEN** CSP policy is being updated
- **THEN** the new policy SHALL be deployed with `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header first
- **AND** violations SHALL be monitored for 24 hours
- **AND** legitimate violations SHALL be addressed before enforcement
- **AND** the policy SHALL be switched to enforcement mode only after validation

#### Scenario: All features work under CSP
- **WHEN** CSP policy is enforced
- **THEN** all authentication flows SHALL work (Clerk)
- **AND** all API requests SHALL work
- **AND** all WebSocket connections SHALL work
- **AND** all images, fonts, and styles SHALL load
- **AND** no console CSP violation errors SHALL appear during normal usage
