**Purpose:** Ensure successful first run of the enhanced CI/CD pipeline.

---

## Pre-Push Checklist

### 1. Local Validation ✓
```bash
cd backend/
./scripts/validate-ci-setup.sh
```
**Expected:** All checks pass (or warnings only)

---

### 2. GitHub Secrets Configuration ⚠️

Navigate to: `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`

**Required Secrets:**

#### CODECOV_TOKEN (Required)
1. Go to https://codecov.io/
2. Sign in with GitHub account
3. Select repository: `singura/backend`
4. Copy token from Settings > General
5. Add as GitHub secret: `CODECOV_TOKEN`

#### SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL (Optional but recommended)
1. Go to Slack workspace
2. Create/configure Incoming Webhook app
3. Copy webhook URL
4. Add as GitHub secret: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`

**Verification:**
```bash
# In GitHub UI: Settings > Secrets > Actions
# Should see:
# ✓ CODECOV_TOKEN (added on YYYY-MM-DD)
# ✓ SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL (added on YYYY-MM-DD)
```

---

### 3. Baseline Files (Optional - First Run)

Baseline files will be created on first successful run. For now, they're optional:
- `tests/fixtures/baselines/performance-baseline.json`
- `tests/fixtures/baselines/detection-baseline.json`

**After first successful run:**
```bash
# If tests generate benchmarks, copy them to baselines
cp tests/output/benchmarks/performance-results.json \
   tests/fixtures/baselines/performance-baseline.json

cp tests/output/benchmarks/detection-metrics.json \
   tests/fixtures/baselines/detection-baseline.json

# Commit baselines
git add tests/fixtures/baselines/
git commit -m "chore: Add performance and detection baselines"
```

---

### 4. Test Locally (Optional)

Run tests locally to ensure they pass before pushing:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:ci

# Run individual suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:security
npm run test:e2e

# Check stress tests
npx jest tests/stress --ci
```

**Expected:** All tests pass locally

### 3. Monitor First Workflow Run

#### Check Workflow Status
1. Go to: `Actions > Test Validation Suite`
2. Click on the workflow run for your PR
3. Monitor job progress (should complete in 8-9 minutes)

#### Expected Job Sequence
```
prepare-and-lint (✓ 3 min)
    ↓
[Parallel - 10 min]
├── unit-tests (✓ 5 min)
├── integration-tests (✓ 8 min)
├── security-tests (✓ 6 min)
├── e2e-tests (✓ 10 min)
└── stress-tests (✓ 8 min)
    ↓
[Analysis - 5 min]
├── coverage-report (✓ 3 min)
├── performance-regression (✓ 2 min)
├── drift-detection (✓ 2 min)
└── flakiness-report (✓ 2 min)
    ↓
test-validation-complete (✓ 1 min)
```

**Total Expected Time:** 8-9 minutes

---

### 4. Verify Workflow Features

#### A. Service Container Health ✓
Check logs in integration-tests job:
```
PostgreSQL health check...
/usr/bin/pg_isready -h localhost -p 5433 -U test_user
localhost:5433 - accepting connections
```

#### B. Coverage Report ✓
Check PR comments for:
```
## Coverage Report

| Metric | Coverage | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Lines | 85.3% | ✅ |
| Statements | 84.7% | ✅ |
| Functions | 82.1% | ✅ |
| Branches | 79.8% | ❌ |
```

#### C. Codecov Integration ✓
1. Check PR comments for Codecov bot
2. Verify coverage diff appears
3. Click Codecov link to see detailed report

#### D. Artifacts Uploaded ✓
Check workflow run page for artifacts:
- ✓ coverage-unit (30 days)
- ✓ coverage-integration (30 days)
- ✓ coverage-security (30 days)
- ✓ coverage-e2e (30 days)
- ✓ performance-benchmarks (30 days)
- ✓ flakiness-report (30 days)

#### E. Performance Regression Check ✓
Check PR comments for:
```
## Performance Regression Check

✅ No performance regressions detected
```

(Or if baseline missing: "Baseline not found. Skipping.")

#### F. Slack Notifications (Optional) ✓
If configured, check Slack channel for:
- ✅ Success: No notification (only on failure)
- ❌ Failure: Notification with run link

---

## Troubleshooting First Run

### Issue 1: Service Container Health Check Fails

**Symptom:**
```
Error: Resource not ready: postgres
```

**Solution:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes (containers need time to start)
- Check service container logs in workflow
- Verify port mappings (5433:5432, 6380:6379)
- Re-run failed job

---

### Issue 2: Coverage Upload Fails

**Symptom:**
```
Error: Codecov token not found
```

**Solution:**
- Verify `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret exists
- Check token is valid at https://codecov.io/
- Re-add secret if needed
- Re-run failed job

---

### Issue 3: Test Timeout

**Symptom:**
```
Exceeded timeout of 30000ms for a test
```

**Solution:**
- This is normal for first run (cold start)
- E2E tests have 3x retry built-in
- Wait for automatic retry
- If still fails, check test logs for specific issue

---

### Issue 4: Baseline Not Found Warnings

**Symptom:**
```
⚠️ Baseline not found. Skipping regression check.
```

**Solution:**
- This is expected on first run
- Performance/drift checks will be skipped
- After run completes, create baselines (see step 3 above)
- Subsequent runs will use baselines

---

### Issue 5: Artifacts Not Uploading

**Symptom:**
No artifacts appear in workflow run

**Solution:**
- Check if tests completed successfully
- Verify coverage reports generated locally
- Check artifact paths in workflow
- Re-run failed job

---

### Issue 6: Parallel Jobs Not Running

**Symptom:**
Jobs run sequentially instead of parallel

**Solution:**
- This is a GitHub Actions limitation on free tier
- Contact GitHub support to enable parallel jobs
- Or upgrade to paid tier
- Jobs will still complete, just slower

---

## Post-First-Run Tasks

### 1. Create Baselines ✓
```bash
# Download artifacts from workflow run
gh run download <run-id>

# Copy to baselines
cp current-benchmarks/performance-results.json \
   tests/fixtures/baselines/performance-baseline.json

cp current-benchmarks/detection-metrics.json \
   tests/fixtures/baselines/detection-baseline.json

# Commit baselines
git add tests/fixtures/baselines/
git commit -m "chore: Add performance and detection baselines from first run"
git push
```

---

### 2. Review Flakiness Report ✓
```bash
# Download flakiness-report artifact
gh run download <run-id> --name=flakiness-report

# Check for flaky tests
cat flakiness-report.json | jq '.flakyTests[]'

# If any found, investigate and fix
```

---

### 3. Update Documentation ✓
```bash
# Add actual runtime metrics to docs/CI_CD_GUIDE.md
# Update performance targets based on first run
# Document any issues encountered
```

---

### 4. Notify Team ✓
Share first run results:
- ✅ Workflow runtime: X minutes
- ✅ Coverage: X%
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Artifacts uploaded
- ✅ Ready for production use

---

## Success Criteria

First run is successful when:

- ✅ Workflow completes in <10 minutes
- ✅ All 11 jobs pass
- ✅ Service containers healthy
- ✅ Coverage report appears in PR
- ✅ Codecov integration working
- ✅ Artifacts uploaded
- ✅ No critical errors in logs
- ✅ Baselines created (or warnings acknowledged)

---

## Next Steps

After successful first run:

1. **Merge PR** to main branch
2. **Monitor production** runs on main branch
3. **Schedule weekly** flakiness report review
4. **Schedule monthly** baseline updates
5. **Schedule quarterly** threshold reviews
6. **Document** any recurring issues

---

## Support

If issues persist after troubleshooting:

1. Check `docs/CI_CD_GUIDE.md` troubleshooting section
2. Review workflow logs in detail
3. Run tests locally to isolate issue
4. Check GitHub Actions status page
5. Contact DevOps team via Slack (#devops)
